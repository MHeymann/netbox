/*
 * This is a generic queue structure.
 *
 * This Implemented by Murray Heymann in 2016, based on a Priority 
 * Queue in the Algorithms textbook by Sedgewick and Wayne.  Their's
 * was written in Java, I translated it to C for compilation on a
 * Linux Machine using gcc or clang.
 *
 * "So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them 
 * to decide.  All we have to decide is what to do with the time 
 * that is given us."
